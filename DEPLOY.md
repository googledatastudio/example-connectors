## Deploy a Community Connector yourself

1.  Visit [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new
    project.
1.  In the Apps Script development environment, select **View > Show manifest
    file**. Replace the contents of this file with the content of the
    `src/appsscript.json` file from the repository.
1.  For every `.js` file under `src`, you will need to create a file in Apps
    Scripts (**File > New > Script File**), then copy over the content from the
    repository.
1.  To use the Community Connector in Data Studio, follow the
    [guide on Community Connector Developer site](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/use).
